  <DT>Short answer:=20
  <DD>An ontology is a specification of a conceptualization. </DD></DL>
<P>The word "ontology" seems to generate a lot of controversy in =
discussions=20
about AI. It has a long history in philosophy, in which it refers to the =
subject=20
of existence. It is also often confused with epistemology, which is =
about=20
knowledge and knowing.=20
<P>In the context of knowledge sharing, I use the term ontology to mean =
a=20
<I>specification of a conceptualization</I>. That is, an ontology is a=20
description (like a formal specification of a program) of the concepts =
and=20
relationships that can exist for an agent or a community of agents. This =

definition is consistent with the usage of ontology as=20
set-of-concept-definitions, but more general. And it is certainly a =
different=20
sense of the word than its use in philosophy.=20
<P>What is important is what an ontology is <I>for</I>. My colleagues =
and I have=20
been designing ontologies for the purpose of enabling knowledge sharing =
and=20
reuse. In that context, an ontology is a specification used for making=20
ontological commitments. The formal definition of ontological commitment =
is=20
given below. For pragmetic reasons, we choose to write an ontology as a =
set of=20
definitions of formal vocabulary. Although this isn't the only way to =
specify a=20
conceptualization, it has some nice properties for knowledge sharing =
among AI=20
software (e.g., semantics independent of reader and context). =
Practically, an=20
ontological commitment is an agreement to use a vocabulary (i.e., ask =
queries=20
and make assertions) in a way that is consistent (but not complete) with =
respect=20
to the theory specified by an ontology. We build agents that commit to=20
ontologies. We design ontologies so we can share knowledge with and =
among these=20
agents.=20

knowledge sharing. Presented at the Padua workshop on Formal Ontology, =

Studies</I>,=20

<H2>Ontologies as a specification mechanism</H2>A body of formally =
represented=20
knowledge is based on a <I>conceptualization</I>: the objects, concepts, =
and=20
other entities that are assumed to exist in some area of interest and =
the=20
relationships that hold among them (Genesereth &amp; Nilsson, 1987) . A=20
conceptualization is an abstract, simplified view of the world that we =
wish to=20
represent for some purpose. Every knowledge base, knowledge-based =
system, or=20
knowledge-level agent is committed to some conceptualization, explicitly =
or=20
implicitly.
<P>An <B>ontology</B> is an explicit specification of a =
conceptualization. The=20
term is borrowed from philosophy, where an Ontology is a systematic =
account of=20
Existence. For AI systems, what "exists" is that which can be =
represented. When=20
the knowledge of a domain is represented in a declarative formalism, the =
set of=20
objects that can be represented is called the universe of discourse. =
This set of=20
objects, and the describable relationships among them, are reflected in =
the=20
representational vocabulary with which a knowledge-based program =
represents=20
knowledge. Thus, in the context of AI, we can describe the ontology of a =
program=20
by defining a set of representational terms. In such an ontology, =
definitions=20
associate the names of entities in the universe of discourse (e.g., =
classes,=20
relations, functions, or other objects) with human-readable text =
describing what=20
the names mean, and formal axioms that constrain the interpretation and=20
well-formed use of these terms. Formally, an ontology is the statement =
of a=20
logical theory.<A=20
href=3D"http://www.ksl.stanford.edu/kst/what-is-an-ontology.html#1">[1]</=
A>
<P>We use common ontologies to describe <I>ontological commitments</I> =
for a set=20
of agents so that they can communicate about a domain of discourse =
without=20
necessarily operating on a globally shared theory. We say that an agent=20
<B>commits</B> to an ontology if its observable actions are consistent =
with the=20
definitions in the ontology. The idea of ontological commitments is =
based on the=20
Knowledge-Level perspective (Newell, 1982) . The Knowledge Level is a =
level of=20
description of the knowledge of an agent that is independent of the =
symbol-level=20
representation used internally by the agent. Knowledge is attributed to =
agents=20
by observing their actions; an agent "knows" something if it acts <I>as =
if</I>=20
it had the information and is acting rationally to achieve its goals. =
The=20
"actions" of agents---including knowledge base servers and =
knowledge-based=20
systems--- can be seen through a tell and ask functional interface =
(Levesque,=20
1984) , where a client interacts with an agent by making logical =
assertions=20
(tell), and posing queries (ask).
<P>Pragmatically, a common ontology defines the vocabulary with which =
queries=20
and assertions are exchanged among agents. Ontological commitments are=20
agreements to use the shared vocabulary in a coherent and consistent =
manner. The=20
agents sharing a vocabulary need not share a knowledge base; each knows =
things=20
the other does not, and an agent that commits to an ontology is not =
required to=20
answer all queries that can be formulated in the shared vocabulary.=20
<P>In short, a commitment to a common ontology is a guarantee of =
consistency,=20
but not completeness, with respect to queries and assertions using the=20
vocabulary defined in the ontology.=20
<P>Notes
<P>[1] Ontologies are often equated with taxonomic hierarchies of =
classes, but=20
class definitions, and the subsumption relation, but ontologies need not =
be=20
limited to these forms. Ontologies are also not limited to conservative=20
definitions, that is, definitions in the traditional logic sense that =
only=20
introduce terminology and do not add any knowledge about the world =
(Enderton,=20
1972) . To specify a conceptualization one needs to state axioms that do =

constrain the possible interpretations for the defined terms. =
